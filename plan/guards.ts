 * Guard for bash commands in Plan Mode.
 *
 * Read-only allowlisted commands pass through. Everything else is blocked:
 * - `destructive` severity hard-blocks (side effects, never confirmed).
 * - `unknown` severity may be approved via the read-only inspection prompt.
 *
 * When tirith enrichment is enabled, blocked commands are additionally scanned
 * by `tirith check --json`. Tirith is enrichment-only and can only strengthen:
 * - block verdict, or warn verdict with warnAction `deny` → escalate to
 *   `destructive` (no confirmation offered) and append findings to the reason.
 * - warn verdict with warnAction `allow` → keep the caller's severity, append
 *   findings to the reason so they reach the agent and the approval prompt.
 * - clean/error → plan's own decision stands unchanged. A missing or erroring
 *   tirith binary must not weaken the block.
 *
 * Allowlisted read-only commands skip tirith entirely (no overhead); tirith's
 * command-structure analysis is most valuable on commands plan already blocks.
